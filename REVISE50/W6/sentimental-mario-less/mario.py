To make things more interesting, first prompt the user with get_int for the half-pyramidâ€™s height, a positive integer between 1 and 8, inclusive.
If the user fails to provide a positive integer no greater than 8, you should re-prompt for the same again.
Then, generate (with the help of print and one or more loops) the desired half-pyramid.
Take care to align the bottom-left corner of your half-pyramid with the left-hand edge of your terminal window.
