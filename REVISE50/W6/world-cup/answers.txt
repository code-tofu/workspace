Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

With a small number of simulations, lower ranked teams seemed to perform better, although their probabilities went down after more simulations were done.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

It seems like the predictions stablized around rthe 10000-100000 region i.e. the probability of winning didn't change much  . Given that the variation of timing between the simulations is less than a second, 100000 should give a sufficiently correct answer
