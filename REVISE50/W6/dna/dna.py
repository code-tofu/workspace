"""
If your program is executed with the incorrect number of command-line arguments, your program should print an error message of your choice
(with print). If the correct number of arguments are provided, you may assume that the first argument is indeed the filename of a valid CSV
 file and that the second argument is the filename of a valid text file.


Your program should open the CSV file and read its contents into memory.
You may assume that the first row of the CSV file will be the column names. The first column will be the word name and the remaining columns will be the STR sequences themselves.

Your program should open the DNA sequence and read its contents into memory.
Sequence is a long string of DNA in text

For each of the STRs (from the first line of the CSV file), your program should compute the longest run of consecutive repeats of the STR in the DNA sequence to identify.Notice that weâ€™ve defined a helper function for you, longest_match, which will do just that!

If the STR counts match exactly with any of the individuals in the CSV file, your program should print out the name of the matching individual.
You may assume that the STR counts will not match more than one individual.
If the STR counts do not match exactly with any of the individuals in the CSV file, your program should print No match
